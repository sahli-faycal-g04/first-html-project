	<h1>Vertualization</h1><br/>
	<p>In computing,<strong>virtualization</strong> refers to the act of creating a virtualization <em>(rather than actual)</em> version of something. <br/>
	This includes virtual computer hardware. virtual stronge devices and virtual network resources.<br/>

	<h1>Levels of Virtualization</h1>
	<ol>
	<li><strong>virtualization at instruction set architecture (ISA) level</strong></li>
	<p>Every machine has an instruction set. This instruction set is an interface between software and hardware.</p>
	<li><strong>Virtualization at Operating System (O.S.) level</strong></li>
	<p>In virtualization at HAL level each virtual machne is built from scratch i.e. by installing O.S., application suites, networking systems, ect.</p>
	<ul>
	<li>In cloud sometimes, we need to initialize 100 Virtual machines at a single time, if we use virtualization at hardware abstraction layer (HAL) level this can take too mach time</li>
	<li>So, to overcome this in Virtualization at Operating system level we share operating system between Virtual machines along with the hardware</li>
	</ul>
	</ol>
